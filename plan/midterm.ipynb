    "\n",
    "## 1. Data Source and Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lap Time Data\n",
    "- Ergast API provides lap time data from 1996 season\n",
    "- API endpoint example:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "http://ergast.com/api/f1/2011/5/laps/1.json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Track Selection\n",
    "- Filter data with circuitId=monza for Monza GP historical records\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Preprocessing and Standardization\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Missing Value Handling\n",
    "- Linear interpolation or direct removal for missing data\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Lap-wise Standardization (Z-score)\n",
    "For each lap N, calculate mean $\\mu_N$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_N$ of all drivers' lap times, then convert each driver's time $t_{iN}$ to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z_{iN} = \\frac{t_{iN} - \\mu_N}{\\sigma_N}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Season/Era Baseline Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relative Delta\n",
    "For each lap, calculate relative difference to the fastest lap of the season:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta_{iN} = \\frac{t_{iN} - \\min_j t_{jN}}{\\min_j t_{jN}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on standardized $z$ or relative delta $\\delta$, construct following statistical features:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean Z-score or δ value\n",
    "$$\\bar{z}_i = \\frac{1}{L}\\sum_{N=1}^{L} z_{iN}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variance\n",
    "- $\\mathrm{Var}(z_i)$ or $\\mathrm{Var}(\\delta_i)$ for performance stability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Features\n",
    "- Best/worst lap performance\n",
    "- Median values\n",
    "- Performance decay slope\n",
    "- Pit stop/safety car detection\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Regression Model Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Target Variable\n",
    "- Total time difference or transformed race position\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Model Selection\n",
    "- Multiple Linear Regression (OLS)\n",
    "- Regularized Regression (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net)\n",
    "- Linear Mixed Model:\n",
    "$$y_i = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{j} \\beta_j x_{ij} + u_{\\text{season}(i)} + \\varepsilon_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Model Training and Validation\n",
    "- Time-based split (e.g., 1996-2018 for training, 2019-2024 for testing)\n",
    "- Grid search for hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "- Evaluation metrics: MSE, MAE, Spearman ρ\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Cross-Era Prediction Process\n",
    "1. Input new driver lap time data\n",
    "2. Season baseline normalization and standardization\n",
    "3. Feature extraction\n",
    "4. Model prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Feasibility and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feasibility\n",
    "- Effective normalization methods\n",
    "- Statistical features capture driver performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- Strategy factors missing\n",
    "- Sudden events impact\n",
    "- Nonlinear effects\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Improvements\n",
    "- Include tactical data and weather information\n",
    "- Consider nonlinear regression methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
